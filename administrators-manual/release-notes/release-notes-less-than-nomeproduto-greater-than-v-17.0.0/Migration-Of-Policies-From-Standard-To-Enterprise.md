# Migration of Policies from Standard to Enterprise

**US ID: US-NPD-7966**

Within the portal, users with ADM profiles can transfer Standard type policies to Enterprise type policies easily, without needing to recreate them manually. To do this, simply access the "Migrate Policies" option, where you can organize and view the devices associated with these policies. After choosing the "Migrate Policy" option, you only need to fill in the name of the new policy and confirm the action. The system then automatically organizes the policies, shows the status of the migration process, and allows you to view the related devices, making policy management between the two platforms easier and more efficient.

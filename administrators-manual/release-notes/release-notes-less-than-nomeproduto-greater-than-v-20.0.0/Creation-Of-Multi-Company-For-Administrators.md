# Creation of Multi-Company for Administrators

**User Story ID: US-NPD-8582**

In the Claro Colombia integration portal, an administrator can now manage multiple companies using a single login. When a license is requested, if there is no company with the provided CNPJ, the system automatically creates a new company for the administrator. If the company is already registered, the administrator is associated with it. This allows for centralized and simplified management of companies, all through a single email account, facilitating access and administration.

# Display of Uninstalled Licenses on the Portal

**US ID: US-NPD-8530**

In the portal, when accessing the "UNINSTALLED LICENSES ON THE PORTAL" Dashboard, you will see how many licenses are still available for use, calculated from the total number of licenses your company owns minus the number of devices that are already registered. This feature makes it easier to track the remaining licenses, making management simpler and more efficient.

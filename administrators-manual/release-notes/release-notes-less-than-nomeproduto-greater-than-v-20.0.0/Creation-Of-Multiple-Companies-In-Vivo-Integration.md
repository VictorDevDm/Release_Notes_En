# Creation of Multiple Companies in Vivo Integration

**US ID: US-NPD-8577**

Description: In the portal, Vivo administrators have the ability to create and manage multiple companies with a single login. When a license is processed and is not linked to any existing company, the system automatically creates a new company. If the company already exists in the system, the license is associated with the user who has the same email, allowing companies to be managed in a unified and simplified manner.

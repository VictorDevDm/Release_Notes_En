# Creation of Multiple Companies on the Operator Portal

**US ID: US-NPD-8587**

Description: On the operator portal, you can create multiple companies under the management of a single administrator using the same login. If the email you provide is already in use, the system notifies you that it belongs to another company and allows the existing user to access the new company as well. You can choose to cancel the process or confirm the registration, linking the email to the new company. This makes managing multiple companies easier and centralized for a single administrator.

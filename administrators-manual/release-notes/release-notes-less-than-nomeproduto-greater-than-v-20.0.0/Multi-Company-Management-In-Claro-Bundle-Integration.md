# Multi-Company Management in Claro Bundle Integration

**US ID:** US-NPD-8576

Description: Now, in the portal, an administrator can create and manage multiple companies using the Claro Bundle Integration with just one login. This means you can control more than one company without needing separate access for each one. When you activate a license and the provided CNPJ is not registered, a new company is automatically created. If the CNPJ is already registered, the company is simply linked to your user account. You can also activate or deactivate users as needed, and they will receive a welcome email when they are associated with a company.

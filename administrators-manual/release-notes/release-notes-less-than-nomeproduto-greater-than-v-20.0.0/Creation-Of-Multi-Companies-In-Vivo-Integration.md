# Creation of Multi Companies in Vivo Integration

**US ID: US-NPD-8577**

Description: In the portal, the Vivo operator can configure multiple companies for a single administrator, allowing them to manage all these companies using just one login. When a new license is processed and there is no company with the provided CNPJ, the system automatically creates this company and associates it with the existing user based on the email. If the company is already registered, the system simply associates the user with the company, thereby simplifying the control and organization of licenses.

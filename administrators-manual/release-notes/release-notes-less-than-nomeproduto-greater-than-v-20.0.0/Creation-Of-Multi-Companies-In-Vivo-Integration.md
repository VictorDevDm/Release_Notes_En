# Creation of Multi-Companies in Vivo Integration

**US ID: US-NPD-8577**

Description: Now, in the portal, administrators can manage multiple companies with the same login through Vivo integration. When a license is processed and does not fit any already registered company, the system automatically creates a new company. If the company is already registered, the system simply associates the user with the existing company. This greatly facilitates the management of multiple companies in a single location for administrators.

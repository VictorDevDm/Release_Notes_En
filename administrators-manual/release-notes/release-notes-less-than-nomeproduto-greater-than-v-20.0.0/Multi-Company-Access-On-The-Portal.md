# Multi-Company Access on the Portal

**US ID:** US-NPD-8584

Administrators using the portal have the ability to access all companies associated with their accounts. Upon logging in, if the administrator is linked to more than one company, an option will appear to choose which company they wish to access. After making a selection, they will be directed straight to the selected company's portal, where they will have access to all functionalities available for that specific organization. If desired, the administrator can switch companies at any time, allowing for practical and efficient device management across different organizations.

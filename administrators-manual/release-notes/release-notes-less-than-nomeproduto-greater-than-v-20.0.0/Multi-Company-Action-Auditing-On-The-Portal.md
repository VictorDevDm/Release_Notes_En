# Multi-Company Action Auditing on the Portal

**User Story ID: US-NPD-8585**

Now, as an administrator on the portal, you can view and keep records of your activities for all the companies you are connected with. When you perform auditable actions while accessing a specific company, those activities will be recorded for that company. If you perform actions before logging in, the records will be assigned to the first company where your user was created. This ensures that your activities across different companies are accurately tracked.

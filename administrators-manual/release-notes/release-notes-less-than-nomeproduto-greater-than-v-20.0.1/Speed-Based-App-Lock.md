# Speed-Based App Lock

**User Story ID: US-NPD-7726**

In the portal, you can configure app locking based on your device's speed. When this option is enabled, the system sets a minimum speed, which by default is 20 km/h, to start locking the apps. You can also adjust the unit of measurement and the wait time, which by default is 1 minute. In the "Applications" tab, you can choose which apps will have the lock enabled or disabled. The app lock will only occur if your device is at or above the configured speed. Once you make the configurations, they are automatically sent to the devices connected to <ProductName>.

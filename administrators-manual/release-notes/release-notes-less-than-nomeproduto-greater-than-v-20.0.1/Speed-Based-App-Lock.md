# Speed-Based App Lock

**US ID: US-NPD-7726**

In the portal, you can configure app locking based on your device's speed. When you enable the "Enable Speed Lock" option, you can set a minimum speed (starting at 20 km/h) and a wait time (initially 1 minute) for the apps to be locked. In the app, the configured apps will be locked as soon as the device reaches or exceeds this speed. They will be unlocked when the device's speed falls below the set threshold. The settings are automatically sent to the devices connected to <ProductName>.

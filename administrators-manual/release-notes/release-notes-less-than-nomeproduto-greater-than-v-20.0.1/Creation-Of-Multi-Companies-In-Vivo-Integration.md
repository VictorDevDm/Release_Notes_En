# Creation of Multi Companies in Vivo Integration

**US ID: US-NPD-8577**

Description: In the portal, it is now possible for an administrator to manage multiple companies using the same login, thanks to the integration with Vivo. If there is no license and no company registered with the provided CNPJ, a new company will be automatically created. If the company is already registered, the user will be associated with it. This makes managing multiple companies much simpler, allowing for more centralized and efficient control and administration from a single access point.

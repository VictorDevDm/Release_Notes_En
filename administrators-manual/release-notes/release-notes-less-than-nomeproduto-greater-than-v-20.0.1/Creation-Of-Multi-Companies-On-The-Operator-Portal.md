# Creation of Multi Companies on the Operator Portal

**ID: US-NPD-8587**

Description: With this feature, administrators can manage multiple companies using just one login on the operator portal. When an administrator creates or edits a company's registration and enters an email that is already registered for another user in the system, a message appears informing that the email is already in use by another company. The administrator then has the option to confirm or cancel the process of associating this email with the new company. If the administrator decides to confirm, the person who owns that email will also gain access to the new company.

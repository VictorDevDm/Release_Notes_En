# Multi-Company Access on the Portal

**US ID: US-NPD-8584**

Description: On the portal, users who are administrators can access multiple companies to which they are connected. Once they log in, if they are associated with more than one company, they will have an option to choose which company they wish to access. After choosing, the portal displays only the information for the selected company, but retains all the functionalities normally accessible. Additionally, the user can easily switch companies without needing to log in again.

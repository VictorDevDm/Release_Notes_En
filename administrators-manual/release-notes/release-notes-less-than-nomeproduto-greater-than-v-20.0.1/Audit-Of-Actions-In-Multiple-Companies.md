# Audit of Actions in Multiple Companies

**US ID: US-NPD-8585**

Description: In the portal, administrators managing multiple companies can have a detailed record of their activities for each of them. Whenever they perform actions that need to be logged, these records are saved in the company where the action was performed. If any action occurs before the user logs in, this activity will be recorded in the first company where they were originally created. This helps ensure that all user activities are accurately monitored across all the companies they manage.

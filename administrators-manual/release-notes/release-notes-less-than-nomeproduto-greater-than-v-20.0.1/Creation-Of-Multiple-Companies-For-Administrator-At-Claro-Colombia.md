# Creation of Multiple Companies for Administrator at Claro Colombia

**US ID: US-NPD-8582**

Description: On the Claro Colombia portal, administrators have the ease of creating and managing multiple companies using a single login. When a license is requested and there is no company linked to the provided CNPJ, a new company will be automatically created. If there is already a company associated with the CNPJ, the user will be connected to that existing company. This makes managing multiple companies simpler and centralized for a single administrator.

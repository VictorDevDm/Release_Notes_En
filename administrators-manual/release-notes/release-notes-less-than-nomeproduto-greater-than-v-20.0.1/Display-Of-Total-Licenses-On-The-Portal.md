# Display of Total Licenses on the Portal

**US ID: US-NPD-8527**

In the portal, when you log in as an administrator or support team member, the main screen titled "TOTAL CONTRACTED LICENSES" will display the total number of licenses your company owns. The system counts and shows the total number of registered licenses, making it easier to view and manage the licenses your company has already contracted.

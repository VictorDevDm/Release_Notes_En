# Creation of Multi-Companies in Claro Bundle Integration

**US ID: US-NPD-8576**

Now, in the portal, a Claro administrator can manage multiple companies using just one login. When you request the activation of a license and the company is not yet registered, it will be automatically created and associated with your administrator profile. If the company already exists, your access will be linked to it. If a user has already been registered but is inactive, they will be reactivated and linked to the company, allowing them to remain active in multiple companies simultaneously. This entire process is automated, facilitating user management and sending welcome notifications to keep everyone informed about the granted access.

# Creation of Multiple Companies in Telcel Integration

**US ID: US-NPD-8578**

Description: Now, on the portal, Telcel administrators have the convenience of managing multiple companies using just one login. When a license is activated and the company is not yet in the system, it will be created automatically, allowing the administrator to manage all their companies in one place. If the company is already registered, the administrator is automatically associated with the correct company, ensuring practical and efficient management.

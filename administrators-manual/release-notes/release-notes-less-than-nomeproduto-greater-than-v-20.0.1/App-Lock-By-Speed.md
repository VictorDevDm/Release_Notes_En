# App Lock by Speed

**User Story ID: US-NPD-7726**

In the portal, you can configure app locking based on your device's speed. This means you can set a minimum speed at which apps will be locked, starting with a default of 20 km/h. Additionally, you can adjust how long the system should wait, from 1 to 10 minutes, before checking the device's speed again. When this setting is enabled, devices connected to <ProductName> automatically receive instructions to apply this rule. Thus, when the device's speed reaches or exceeds the limit you have set, the selected apps are locked. If the speed decreases, the system checks again to consider whether the apps should be unlocked.
